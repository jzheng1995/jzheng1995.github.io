This is my first post! This is a blog post built with Jekyll and Markdown, hosted on Github. Let's see what we can do.

# Syntax

We can make headings!

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

Text can be **bold**, *italicized*, or ***both***. 

> We can also make block quotes.

1. Lists
2. Can be
3. Ordered

- Lists 
- Can also be
- Not ordered

We can upload pictures.

```
We can make code blocks.
```

[^1]: This is the footnote.

~~Strike through words.~~

- [x] Complete a task list
- [ ] Finish my analyses
- [ ] Save the world

Unfortunately we have to use html tags to natively subscript<sub>2</sub>, superscript<sup>2</sup>, and <mark>highlight</mark>. 

We also have to use html to natively use &#128580; .

We can use a sentence with a footnote. [^1]
