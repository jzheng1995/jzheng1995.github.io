  abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the importance of identifying factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Disease threat and coping responses are central to health behavior engagement and present potential alterable targets for intervention. Purpose To examine the roles of perceived threat of COVID-19 and coping in vaccine hesitancy, we examined how coping strategies involving approach and avoidance interact with perceived threat of COVID-19 to predict vaccine hesitancy. Methods We used data from 1570 North American participants who reported their vaccine hesitancy as part of a longitudinal study assessing psychosocial responses to the pandemic. We used logistic regression models and mean scores of perceived threat of COVID-19, approach coping, and avoidance coping from prior timepoints to predict vaccine hesitancy in December 2020, when COVID-19 vaccines were first being approved for use in North America. Results Low perceived threat of COVID-19 was associated with greater likelihood of being vaccine hesitant. However, approach coping moderated this association, such that people who engaged in more approach coping were less likely to be vaccine hesitant even when they did not feel personally threatened by COVID-19. In contrast, avoidance coping was associated with greater likelihood of vaccine hesitancy regardless of perceived threat of COVID-19. Conclusions Our results illustrate the contributions of approach and avoidance coping to vaccine hesitancy and in doing so, provide preliminary evidence for coping behavior to serve as a target for intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy.},

  abstract = {Experiencing stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic such as health-related concern, social isolation, occupational disruption, financial insecurity, and resource scarcity can adversely impact mental health; however, the extent of the impact varies greatly between individuals. In this study, we examined the role of neuroticism as an individual-level risk factor that exacerbates the association between pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms. With repeated assessments of pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms collected from 3181 participants over the course of the pandemic, we used multilevel modeling to test if neuroticism moderated the association between pandemic stressors and depressive symptoms at both between- and within-person levels. At the between-person level, we found that participants who reported more pandemic stressors on average had higher levels of depressive symptoms and that this association was stronger among those high in neuroticism. At the within-person level, reporting more pandemic stressors relative to one's average on any given occasion was also associated with heightened depressive symptoms and this effect was similarly exacerbated by neuroticism. The findings point to pandemic stressor exposure and neuroticism as risk factors for depressive symptoms and, in demonstrating their synergistic impact, may help identify individuals at greatest risk for adverse psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Rationale The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on lives around the globe. In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. Objective The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. Method A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. Results Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. Conclusion Findings from the present study can help to identify key groups at risk for mental health problems during the pandemic, and indicate actionable areas for targeted intervention.},
